# Order Matters: Sequence to Sequence for Sets Final Project Proposal (Vinyals et al., 2016)
#### Amit Huli & Sharon Mordechai
This project contains the implementation of the article: Order Matters: Sequence to Sequence for Sets Final Project Proposal (Vinyals et. al, 2016)
The example given here is for the sorting experiment described in the article.

In order to run the experiments, use the experiments_runner.py (for the sorting experiment) or tsp_experiments_runner.py (for TSP experiment) and add the relevant hyperparameters accordingly for each experiment. Better to use it inside a notebook for better visibility.
